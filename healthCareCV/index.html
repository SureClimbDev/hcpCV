									<p>Having qualified from The University Of Manchester with a degree in adult nursing, I started my career on the cardiology ward where I worked for 4 years. From there I went to A&E, where I worked for a further 5 years before joining the ICU team at my local hospital where I worked for a past 11 years. I have undertaken and completed my Advanced Nurse Practitionars course, where I have learnt to prescribe and diagnose. But have lost the spark with working in the same environment so am looking to privatise my serivces.</p>
